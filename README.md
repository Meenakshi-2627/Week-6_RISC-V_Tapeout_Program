# Week-6 RISC-V Tapeout Program

**Timeline:** 26/10/2025 to 01/11/2025

---

## Objectives

### Lab Objectives

- Understand the complete ASIC design flow from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools
- Gain hands-on experience with OpenLane automated RTL to GDSII flow
- Learn to perform synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, and routing
- Analyze and optimize timing constraints for digital designs
- Implement custom standard cells and integrate them into the design flow
- Perform static timing analysis and resolve timing violations
- Generate Power Distribution Network (PDN) for the design
- Execute detailed routing using TritonRoute
- Conduct post-route timing analysis with parasitic extraction
- Verify design rules and layout versus schematic (LVS) checks

### Context

This week focuses on the practical implementation of physical design using the OpenLane flow with Sky130 PDK. The program covers the entire backend flow starting from a synthesized netlist of the RISC-V based PicoRV32a processor core to the final GDSII layout ready for fabrication. Participants will work with industry-standard open-source EDA tools and learn optimization techniques essential for modern chip design.
